think of better home page content
hide profile and cart buttons if not logged in
with pictures or something for different tech functionalities
account drop down in navbar
abstract product card
and maybe grid too, to use in cart and products components
nice ui
use redux

search results number
x-able pop up for above
also hides after page change etc.
sign in/sign up/welcome username/edit account drop down in header
